#Tips
#1. Make sure to use the %prefix% to add the prefix in front of messages.
#2. If you wish to use more then one line for a message just go from a line to a list.
#Examples:
#  Line:
#    No-Permission: '%prefix%&cYou do not have permission to use that command.'
#  List:
#    No-Permission:
#      - '%prefix%&cYou do not have permission'
#      - '&cto use that command. Please try another.'
